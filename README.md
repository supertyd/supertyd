## Hi there 👋


**Yuedong Tan(谭跃东)** is an Ph.D. student at INSAIT/University of Würzburg, under the supervision of Danda Pani Paudel, Radu Timfote, and Luc Van Gool. Previously, I obtained my master’s degree from Xidian University in June 2025. Before that, I received my B.E. degree from Chang’an University, China, in July 2022. I was an intern or visiting student at Tele AI, supervised by Jiawei Shao and Xuelong Li.
