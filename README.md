## üëã Hi there

**Yuedong Tan(Ë∞≠Ë∑É‰∏ú)** is a Ph.D. student at INSAIT/University of W√ºrzburg, under the supervision of Danda Pani Paudel, Radu Timofte, and Luc Van Gool. Previously, I obtained my master‚Äôs degree from Xidian University in June 2025. Before that, I received my B.E. degree from Chang‚Äôan University, China, in July 2022. I was an intern or visiting student at Tele AI, supervised by Jiawei Shao and Xuelong Li.

## Primary Focus Areas
- **Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM)** - Advancing vision-language understanding and reasoning
- **Tool-Use Agents** - Creating intelligent systems that can effectively utilize external tools and APIs


> My ultimate goal is to develop autonomous agents capable of leveraging diverse tools to independently explore and understand the world, bridging the gap between AI systems and real-world interaction.
